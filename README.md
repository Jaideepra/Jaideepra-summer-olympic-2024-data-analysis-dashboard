Hi everyone today i am happy to share with you that recently i have completed project of Summer Olympics 2024   with the help of the microsoft power bi tool where i provide complete visualization of Summer Olympics 2024  .I provided some key insightful from this data.

1- I used several data filteration technique to filter data  for eg- sql queries,Numeric Filtering , text filtering etc.

2 .-I used custom column and conditional column in power bi for  finding age group of medalist of each country.

3.- I did some sort of data modeling  for enhancing my report and will use my data effectively  for e.g. convert many to many relationship into 1to many relationship bidirectionally so that i will get desired result.

4.- I used Dax  formula for desired insight from the given data for e.g. count, distinct, sum etc. 

key insights-
